This is a project related to predictions whether the fish sample is fresh or stale. Usually fishes which are stale have sunken yellowish eyes and are not bright where as the fresh ones have bright and shiny eyes. This project utilizes a basic convolutional neural network structure with basic codes written for defining the model and testing it.
